    "# Run a pre-trained predictor\n",

    "This notebook is for when you want to try my trained \"best predictor\" on new data in your possession. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be warned! I fully expect this to be quite bad at prediction... there are going to be batch differences between your data and ours, in terms of things that are controllable or potentially correctable (wetlab things, bioinformatics pipeline) and things that are not (e.g., your sample is composed of different genetic variants than mine, or subjects have very different epigentics due to environmental factors).  Maybe someday when I've collected an order of magnitude or two more samples the uncontrollable batch effects won't be as big a problem.  On that note, if you would like to contribute your samples to that endeavor please contact me: [jfleischer@salk.edu](mailto:jfleischer@salk.edu) :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements: FPKM/RPKM data collected in a single batch on a single platform, or maybe if you're lucky data you have batch corrected from multiple batches might work.  TPM might work, raw counts is almost certain to have huge issues. The data should ideally be top-expressing isoform counts per gene; maybe sum-of-isoform-expression-levels per gene works, but it's sure to be worse since that's not what I trained on.  To avoid problems where your batch has a different top isoform than my batch for a given gene, the data should be labelled with gene names rather than transcript/isoform names.  See my comments on loading data, in the next set of notebook cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have the best chance of this working if you use the same wetlab procedures and bioinformatics pipeline we used in [our paper.](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1186/s13059-018-1599-6).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I know that's not realistic; your wetlab is going to be different and you can't ask them to rerun everything... probably you'll do better to use my other notebook, which allows you to train your own predictor on your unique data.  If you don't have enough data of your own to train a classifier (I'd say 3+ samples per decade samples, spread from 0 - 70 years would be a good minimum) perhaps you could consider [downloading our data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113957) and combining it with yours using some kind of batch correction software (like ComBat, SVA, etc).  I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:jfleischer@salk.edu) if you try this!!\n",

    "This notebook requires versions of the following libraries that are at least as recent as:\n",

    "* Python 2.7.9\n",
    "* Numpy 1.15.2\n",

    "* Sklearn 0.19\n",
    "* Matplotlib 2.1.0\n",
    "* Seaborn 0.7.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this notebook will use a binary dump of the ensemble, using a later version of these libraries may result in putting the right bits in the wrong places... that is, if sklearn changes the underlying data structures in future versions the classifier might be broken even though it loads just fine.  I have tested the interchangability of sklearn 0.19 and 0.20, and  training on one and testing on the other produces identical results with my data, even though it throws a warning about the different sklearn versions during the loading process.  I make no guarantee that this will still work with future versions of sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could solve this issue by serializing the ensemble and each of its components to a format like JSON of YAML instead of binary.  I know enough to know the problem isn't trivial; I hope to revisit it someday, or if you're a python expert, maybe you'd like to contribute some code?"

    "\n",
    "Why would you choose one or the other?  Well if you have deep sequencing and can get all the isoforms reasonbly quantified, definitely go for the transcript level.  If you don't have enough depth to get all isoforms, then you should probably choose gene level, since there's a possibility for any given gene that you would have a different top isoform than our batch.   In that case you would be using fewer variables to make the prediction, which might results in a loss of predictive power.  Of course going to gene level representation may also be a loss of predictive power... there's always a chance that what changes with age is WHICH isoform gets expressed ;)  So in that case, maybe try it both ways?? \\*shrug\\*"
